<p>G3 is one of the campus companies in Somaiya which uses the reusable papers from lab writeups and waste printouts to create books, notepads and bookmarks. 
These books are completely handmade except for the binding and we sell these during major Somaiya events like Abhiyantriki and Symphony. 
The entire money goes to PUSH kjsce to help the underprivileged students.</p>
